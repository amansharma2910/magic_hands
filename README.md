# Magic Hands

A quick project to demonstrate how you can easily create your own Deep Learning models using Tensorflow and Keras.

To run this project, follow these steps.

 * STEP 1: Install any distribution of conda (anaconda, miniconda, miniforge). Kindly refer to Google to see how to install these.

 * STEP 2: Create virtual environment with conda.

 ```bash
 conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
 ``` 
 * STEP 3: Activate your virtual environment.

 ```bash
 conda activate <env_name>
 ```

 Once the environment is created and initialized, you can run the project. You can download the data from here:

 To run the script using pretrained model, run the following command.

 ```bash
 python magic_hands.py
 ```
